## Requirements 

- No MVP. 3 hours in teams of 3. 
- Create a Dashboard that calls from the Github, CodeWars and HackerRank API.
- Render the data.

---

## Build Steps

- git clone https://github.com/mitchanderson202/Nology-Hackerthon.git
- npm i
- npm run dev

---

## Design Goals

- Given the time restraints, design was done last and was meant to be simple.

---

## Known issues

- HackerRank search doesn't work.
- No requirements for the Form, causes errors if you don't search for Github or Codewars.

---

## Future Goals

- As this was designed to be done in 3 hours. I don't want to touch it again as it's not meant to be perfect.
